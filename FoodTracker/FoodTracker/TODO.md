# TO DO

##  Fix the image bug

- The Korvstroganoff does not have a photo and you can not add a photo to it either

## Implement a Meal model

- A meal is currently implemented using a dictionary. Replace this with a proper model.

## Persist the Meal models to disk

- Make Meal conform to Codable
- Add a generic extension on Array that will let us store and retrieve an Array of Codable elements
